### Output configuration
#
# Default wallpaper (more resolutions are available in /usr/share/backgrounds/sway/)
# output * bg /home/elle/Downloads/papers/wallpapers-main/misc/comfy-home.png fill
#
# Example configuration:
#
   output HDMI-A-1 resolution 1440x900 position 1440,0
   output HDMI-A-1 max_render_time 6
#
# You can get the names of your outputs by running: swaymsg -t get_outputs

### Idle configuration
#
# Example configuration:
#
# exec swayidle -w \
#          timeout 300 'swaylock -f -c 000000' \
#          timeout 600 'swaymsg "output * dpms off"' resume 'swaymsg "output * dpms on"' \
#          before-sleep 'swaylock -f -c 000000'
#
# This will lock your screen after 300 seconds of inactivity, then turn off
# your displays after another 300 seconds, and turn your screens back on when
# resumed. It will also lock your screen before your computer goes to sleep.

### Input configuration
#
# Example configuration:
#
   input * {
       xkb_layout "us,ru"
       xkb_options grp:sclk_toggle
       accel_profile "flat"
       pointer_accel 0
       scroll_factor 1.5
       repeat_delay 225
       repeat_rate 50
   }
#
# You can get the names of your inputs by running: swaymsg -t get_inputs
# Read `man 5 sway-input` for more information about this section.
